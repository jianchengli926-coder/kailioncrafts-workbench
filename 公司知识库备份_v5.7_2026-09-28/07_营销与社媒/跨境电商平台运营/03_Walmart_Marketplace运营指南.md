# Walmart Operations Guide / Walmart Marketplace 运营指南

> 说明（中文）：Walmart Marketplace 是美国第三大第三方平台，无月费、无开店费，流量增长快，但入驻门槛高（必须美国公司实体）。对 KaiLionCrafts 是中期目标，建议在 Amazon 跑通 6 个月后申请。

Source: https://marketplace.walmart.com/ + seller-registration-guide (retrieved 2026-09-27)

Walmart requires **all** of the following:

- **History of marketplace/eCommerce success** (existing Amazon/eBay/Shopify store with sales).
- Products with **GS1-issued GTIN/UPC** (no fake UPCs).
- Catalog compliant with Walmart Prohibited Products Policy.
- **Fulfillment via WFS or a US B2C warehouse with returns capability** (cannot ship cross-border from China).
- US return address + US customer service phone/email.

### 1.1 Application Steps

1. Apply at https://marketplace.walmart.com/apply (review typically 1-2 weeks).
2. Complete Seller Profile (tax info via W-9, banking).
3. Integrate listing feed (bulk CSV or API).
4. Set up shipping templates (WFS or self-fulfilled).
5. Go live.

### 1.2 Fee Structure

- **No monthly subscription fee, no setup fee**.
- **Referral fee**: category-dependent, typically **6-15%** (Home Improvement / Kitchen roughly 15%).
- WFS fulfillment fees comparable to FBA.

## 2. Operating Rules / 运营规则

### 2.1 Price Competitiveness

- Walmart algorithm **suppresses Buy Box** if your price is not competitive vs. other sellers (including Walmart.com first-party).

### 2.2 Shipping SLA

- WFS orders get "2-day delivery" badge automatically.
- Late fulfillment rate directly impacts "Service Level" score.

## 3. WFS (Walmart Fulfillment Services)

- Similar to FBA: ship bulk inventory to Walmart fulfillment centers; Walmart picks/packs/ships/handles returns.
- Eligible products earn **Walmart 2-Day Delivery** badge.
- WFS fees: pick/pack + weight-based shipping + monthly storage (similar banding to FBA).
- **刀具注意**: WFS accepts kitchen/utility knives; restricted/assisted knives may be blocked at inbound.

## 4. Advertising / Walmart Connect

- **Sponsored Products**: CPC keyword ads on search results and item pages.
- **Sponsored Brands**: search-result banners with logo + products.
- **Sponsored Display**: retargeting across Walmart network.
- No DSP self-serve for new sellers; invite-only.
- ACoS benchmarks similar to Amazon (15-30% mature).
